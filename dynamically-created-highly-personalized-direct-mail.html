      	<h1>What we do</h1>
        <h2>Personalized is better.</h2>
        <p>Personalized marketing, or one-to-one marketing, individual marketing is a marketing strategy used to deliver individualized messages and product offerings. Simply put, the more you really know your customer, the better you can communicate, right? Being relavent and personable gets better response rate, increases conversion, and can boost your average order value. In the end, if you're looking to get a return on ad cost, the more you can scale that "personal touch" the better. So why is personalized marketing considered more of an online strategy in an omni-channel world?</p>
        <h2>Personalized Direct Mail</h2>
        <p>What comes to mind when you think of personalized mailers? Truth is, if you're doing more than swapping out "current resident" with your customer's name, you're doing more than most. Why is it that moments after leaving an ecommerce site, we're targeted with the last viewed products and a promotion to come back, but we still get the same printed post card that everyone else gets in their mailbox at home? If it's not a customer data problem, then where is the disconnect? </p>
        <h2>The problem is... Digital Printing is still partying like it's 1999!</h2>
        <p>Variable Data Printing (VDP), smetimes called Variable Information Printing (VIP), promises personalized content based on virtually any bit customer data. While this is true, and also a major technological advancement for printing presses all over the world, there's a catch. The process is archaic at best.</p>
        <p>Once, you have an approved design, instead of sending your printer the "print-ready" PDF you just exported, you go back through the source file and prep your variables and manually package a zip file with your fonts, images, and every possible text change or image you'd like swap out. Then, your local printshop stitches all of this together offline before running it on the digital press. Not only does this process take more time and resoures, but the tools we use severely limit the variables we even consider. You'd have to package up your entire website just to recommend similar products!</p>
